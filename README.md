In the bottom left of the application there are 2 buttons to zoom in and zoom out current loaded map. In the bottom left with 4 buttons “Up, Down, Left, Right” can be used to move the map in those directions. Home button gets map to the first position of the map.

### Code Documentation

In this application, I have developed it as a QWidget and it includes QWebEngineView as the main component as it shows a google map. As 3rd party libraries I have used google map api to render a google map with necessary javascript functions. There are only main class and widget class in this application. Also 3 html files are used to deliver javascript functions which uses google map api.

#### Widget class

With above code a google map is loaded to the QWebEngineView inside the widget ui which created by promoting a QWidget to a QWebEngineView.
For geocode and reverse geocode separate html files with javascript was as mapgeocode.html and mapreversegeocode.html.
